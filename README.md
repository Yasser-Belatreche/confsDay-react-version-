# Components Structure

If you wanna dive into the code click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1OJeopM_dzWCf_BX3kuhd2FneGVE69wPQ) you will find the structure of the components.

I tried as much as i can to not repeat myself by using some react magic, you will find in some folders a file has the

name `data.js` i put in it the data needed in that component so i can implement it dynamically and like this i keep the

code as clean as possible.
